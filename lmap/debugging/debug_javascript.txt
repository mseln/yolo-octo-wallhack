To debug javascript you need to use some sort of tool, otherwise you would only get a white page if something goes wrong and that doesn't say too much does it?

One of those tools is firebug (https://getfirebug.com/) which is an both free and open source plugin for browsers. With firebug you can see the source of the page you're visiting. It can also enable javascript's console to get error messages, which makes it a lot easier to find the missing "}" for instance. Firebug will also notify you about errors and warnings when you're browsing the site, if enabled.

Another way to debug javascript is to use alert which generates a pop-up window containing text. 
Example: 
    alert('hello'); 
Will create a pop-up window saying hello. This can be good to see if a codeblock is reached. 
You can also out put one or several variables.
Example:
    var a = 0;
    var b = 10;
    var c = 'hello';
    var d = 10.3;
    alert('a: ' + a.toString() + '\n' +
          'b: ' + b.toString() + '\n' +
          'c: ' + c.toString() + '\n' +
          'd: ' + d.toString() + '\n');
